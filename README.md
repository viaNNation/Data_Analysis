# Data Analysis for business growth

The idea behind the project is to try to extract insights from the provided data. For this, I set myself six challenges that are listed in the notebook itself.

With this data manipulation and visualization, we can gain a more focused view of the business numbers and create action plans to increase sales, understand where our strengths lie, and work together with management in decision-making to drive the company's growth across various sectors.

Some examples of areas that can benefit are: planning, marketing, sales team, CX, CS, and so on. The analysis can also assist in the scope of meetings with management and in the creation of dashboards for tracking key indicators

## Instructions

To use the code, you will need to open the notebook in an IDE like Spyder or VS Code. If you prefer, you can also open it directly in Google Colab.

The CSV file will be read directly from the file available on my GitHub, so there will be no need to download the file to your hard drive for reading

I hope you enjoy the work!
